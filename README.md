# Concordance

This program makes a concordance out of the text in a file. It does this by implementing a linked list, incrementing the frequency of a word, and then printing the concordance out to the screen.

## Getting Started (How to Run)

Copy this repository and run the makefile on a command line. Then to execute do

```
Concordance <file with text>
```
## Example Output

A file name called "fish" that includes the text

```
Red Fish, Blue Fish, Green Fish. So many colors of fish.
```

Would result in the program printing out a concordance that looks like

```
fish Concordance:
blue 1
colors 1
fish 4
green 1
many 1
of 1
red 1
so 1
```
